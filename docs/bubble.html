    <h3>.Com Bubble</h3>
    <p>Amazon was launched in 1999 and Ebay’s development came soon after. The company’s respective CEOs had felt that the internet was a place to do business and create a marketplace where anyone could sell their products. It would create a large source of revenue. </p>
    <h3>eBay & Amazon</h3>
    <p>eBay’s website was fairly simple. Anyone who sold anything had a level playing field where they could sell whatever they wanted. Amazon had the same ideals and both companies grew rapidly with the new amount of the users that were joining the internet. Amazon was a marketplace with its focus on the books as Bezos felt that a plethora of books can make a good profit.
        Both companies sold very widely, to 45 countries and all 50 states. With the speed of the spread of the web, more and more people gravitated towards online shopping and marketplaces.<br>
        The networks continued to grow which would create more users and more things to sell.
        Amazon stocks had doubled which would mark the start of the internet bubble and create the .Com boom which would be a foundation for online shopping taken seriously.
    </p>
    <h3>Boom</h3>
    <p>Because of the effect that eBay and Amazon had, many e-commerce companies had begun to attempt to get their companies going on the internet. The majority of these companies had failed, however. </p>
