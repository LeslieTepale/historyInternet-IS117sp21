    <h3>Invention of the Internet</h3>
    <p>The internet has evolved from a small form of military intel usage, to having millions of users around the world. It has grown very rapidly and has had an enormous impact on the lives of everyone that uses it, through its easy form of communication and access to information. </p>
    <h3>Uses of the Internet</h3>
    <p>The internet can be used in several ways. Many use it as a form of communication, whether it be through businesses in a workplace setting, or socially with friends and family. It can also be used in finances, which was a big cause of rapid financial growth in its development. Others use it as a personal store, shopping online for things on sites such as amazon, reducing the need to leave the house. </p>
    <br><h3>Early Development</h3>
    <p>The Computer was initially used in the military, through use of gathering intel and transferring information. Computer research grew after the creation of NASA. <br>
        The technology to use the internet was seen in telephone systems, in which wires would allow connection between phones in different locations.<br>
        Fishnet Networks: If one form of communication was destroyed, there were still other ways for the two systems to be able to communicate.<br>
        Hot Potato Routing: A message arriving to a network, despite part of the message being destroyed in the transfer. This is done by converting the data into small pieces of information.<br>
        1969: Creating a system in which two computers would be able to communicate on the same network in order for more efficient communication.
    </p>
    <br><h3>ARPANET</h3>
    <p>Computer to computer communication in which one computer would send a program to another. It would be the first of its kind to have distributed control, becoming a foundation for what the internet would become. It was the first to use TCP/IP Protocols. <br>
        It had only 25 computers in its network but this number would skyrocket after a convention held by Arpa.<br>
        In 1983 TCP IP was established as the universal standard for computer networks of interconnected computers. ARPANET became a tool used for intel and research, rather than for commercial purposes.
